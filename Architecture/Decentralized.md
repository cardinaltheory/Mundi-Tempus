# Decentralized

As computers are becoming more and more powerful and users have access to better internet,
some computers/servers may be powerful enough to run the decentralized version of the game server.

This is a modern approach to be able to scale as more people play together and can potentially allow an
unlimitted amount of players to be together with little to no lag.
